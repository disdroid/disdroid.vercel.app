In 2015 Maxwell papers, namely the Daily Mirror and Examiner Live, Huddersfield (also Yorkshire Live) illegally leaked medical details belonging to our researcher.

There are two cover-ups here - the child abusing judo coach who walked free from Huddersfield court multiple times, yet was given a ten year sentence elsewhere, and who formed the subject of the articles that were construed as "trolling" by a "fantasist", and the case of the actual fantasist Carl Beech, who, along with corrupt officers in the Met, targeted responsible and reputable members of the establishment, including [Field Marshall Lord Bramall](https://disdroid.vercel.app/homeland-incursion-metropolitan-police) who appears to have been deliberately prevented from contacting Mark Fisher to provide a statement proving his innocence, given that Sir Edwin is one of his godparents and lifelong friend.

As it stands, we are now subject to a massive data breach by the Met, allowing criminal gangs to align with terrorists and target British personel.
