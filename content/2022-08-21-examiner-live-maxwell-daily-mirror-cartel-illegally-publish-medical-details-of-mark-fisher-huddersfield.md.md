In 2015 Maxwell papers, namely the Daily Mirror and Examiner Live, Huddersfield (also Yorkshire Live) illegally leaked medical details belonging to our researcher.

There are two cover-ups here - the child abusing judo coach who walked free from Huddersfield court multiple times, yet was given a ten year sentence elsewhere, and who formed the subject of the articles that were construed as "trolling" by a "fantasist", and the case of the actual fantasist Carl Beech, who, along with corrupt officers in the Met, targeted responsible and reputable members of the establishment, including Field Marshall Lord Bramall who was deliberately prevented from contacting Mark Fisher to provide a statement proving his innocence, given that Sir Edwin is one of his godparents.

As it stands, we are now subject to a massive data breach by the Met, allowing criminal gangs to align with terrorists and target British personel.
