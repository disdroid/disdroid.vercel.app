### Tracking the timeline between a series of criminal assaults and suspicious activity by Kirklees Council officials.

Despite having been warned that this matter is now in police hands, rather than wait until the investigation into his involvement in a child trafficking ring is concluded, this councillor panics and decides to escalate. This was his preference, rather than resolve [the issue described here](https://disdroid.vercel.app/kirklees-council-cartel) by apologising.
